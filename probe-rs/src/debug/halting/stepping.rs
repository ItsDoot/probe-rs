/// Currently we have support for 'instruction' level stepping, as well
/// as 'step-over' 'step-into', and 'step-out' at 'statement' level.
/// Note: Because of the way the DWARF debug information is currently generated by the Rust compiler,
/// (no explicity 'basic_block' information is generated), the the 'step over' functionality
/// at 'statement' level will be rare, and most often, we will have to fall back to
/// behave more like 'step over' at 'line' level.

    /// ### Implementation Notes for stepping multiple instructions at a time:
    /// - This implementation builds on the [VerifiedBreakpoint] implementation, with additional heurstics
    ///   available based on the halted target's stackframe information, to determine suitable target locations
    ///   for stepping.
    /// - If a hardware breakpoint is available, we will set it at the desired location, run to it, and release it.
    /// - If no hardware breakpoints are available, we will do repeated instruction steps until we reach the desired location.
    /// ### Usage Note:
    /// - Currently, no special provision is made for the effect of interrupts that get triggered
    ///   during stepping. The user must ensure that interrupts are disabled during stepping, or
    ///   accept that stepping may be diverted by the interrupt processing on the core.
    /// ### About errors returned:
    /// Sometimes the target program_counter is at a location where the debug_info program row data does not contain valid statements
    /// for halt points, and we will return a `DebugError::NoValidHaltLocation`. In this case, we recommend the consumer of this API step the core to the next instruction
    /// and try again, with a reasonable retry limit. All other error kinds are should be treated as non recoverable errors.
