/// [SteppingGranularity](https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol/specification#Types_SteppingGranularity)
/// In the context of the `probe-rs` debugger, an instruction block is a contiguous series of instructions
/// which belong to a single [`Sequence`].
/// The key difference between instructions in a block, and those in a [`gimli::LineSequence`], is that we can rely
/// on the 'next' instruction in the block to be the 'next' instruction the processor will execute (barring any interrupts).
/// ### Implementation discussion:
/// Indentifying the boundaries of each [`Block`] is the key to identifying valid halt locations, and is the primary
/// purpose of the [`Block`] struct. Current versions of Rust (up to rustc 1.76.0) does not populate the
/// `DW_LNS_basic_block` attribute of the line program rows in the DWARF debug information. The implication of this is that
/// we need to infer the boundaries of each block withing the sequence of instructions, from other blocks, as well as
/// from the prologue and epilogue markers. The approach taken is as follows:
/// - The first block is the prologue block, and is identified by the `DW_LNS_set_prologue_end` attribute.
/// - If the sequence starting address is a non-inlined function, then if the DWARF `DW_AT_subprogram` attribute
///   for the function uses:
///   - `DW_AT_ranges`, we use those ranges as initial block boundaries. These ranges only covers
///      parts of the sequence, and we start by creating a block for each covered range, and blocks
///      for the remaining covered ranges.
/// - To facilitate 'stepping', we need to identify how blocks transition from one to the next.
///  - The `from_block` (left edge) and `to_block` (right edge) are the optional blocks. (Think simple AST).
///  - The `to_block` is one of the following:
///    - The address of the first instruction in the next block in the sequence, if there is one.
///    - The address of first instruction, after the instruction that called this sequence (return register value).
